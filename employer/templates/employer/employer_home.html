    <p>
      An Employer is one of the two main profile types on this website. 
      An Employer can make job listings and manage them, An Employer can also view applications 
      made by Applicants, change the status of each application and more.

  <div class="text-center">
    <h1 class="h3 mt-8">How do I get started?</h1>
    <p>
      You can start by making a Job Listing, fill in the required information.
      After that you can go to the Job Board and view all of your Listings.
      Unlike Applicants, Employers can only view their own listings.
      From there you can manage a listing which will allow you to manage the applications,
      or delete the listing.
