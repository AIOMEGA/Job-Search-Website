Unique Feature
**Dormancy**
- If an Applicant's application is accepted then the user has the option either
- Accept or Set Dormant
- If Dormant the application cannot expire or be revolked by the Company
- The User cannot apply to a job that is dormant
- The User must re-activate the listing and request a positiion at the company to be hired

This unique feature allows workers to quickly rebound to another job if layed off suddenly as the listing doesn't need to go through interviews again since they were already previously deemed suitable.
